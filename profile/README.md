# Global Seismology Research Group (Barbara Romanowicz's group)

The Global Seismology Research Group resides at UC Berkeley, within the Department of Earth and Planetary Science and the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory.

Our research focuses on structure and dynamics of the deep earth, from the crust to the inner core. We tackle theoretical wave propagation problems in complex 3D media, including forward modeling and full waveform tomographic inversion (FWI) for elastic as well as anelastic structure. In order to better understand the chemical and thermal state of the mantle and the processes operating therein, we seek to apply the latest findings of the mineral physics community within the context of our seismic probing. We also study earthquake source mechanisms and scaling laws, as well as global seismic moment release and its relation to plate tectonics. One of our recent research directions concerns the Earth's "hum" and the insights it brings to ocean/atmosphere/solid earth interactions. Another one is "Box Tomography", i.e. how to perform FWI of remote target regions in the deep earth while keeping the computational cost manageable.

Our research is supported through a variety of sources, mostly through grants from NSF.
